## CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS


## GOAL: create an unsupervised machine learning model to divide customers into segments to optimize each customer’s significance for a business’s marketing team. 

Customer segmentation is the process of grouping consumers according to characteristics that are shared by all of those in a cluster. 

We will also cover principal component analysis (PCA), data visualizations, and how to deploy models in the real world.
